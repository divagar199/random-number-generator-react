## 📋 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create a functional component that:
1.  Uses the **`useState` hook** to manage the generated number.
2.  Implements **Conditional Rendering** to show a placeholder message ("No number generated yet") before the first click.
3.  Updates the UI dynamically upon clicking a button.

## ✨ Features
* **Dynamic State Updates:** Instantly updates the DOM without reloading the page.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Intelligently switches between the placeholder text and the generated number.
* **Random Logic:** Generates a unique integer between 1 and 100 on every click.
* **Clean UI:** styled with CSS for a modern, card-based look.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Create React App / Vite)
* **Styling:** CSS3
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Deployment:** Vercel
